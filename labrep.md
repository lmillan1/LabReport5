# Lab Report 5

1.
Whan environment are you using( computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)? 
Terminal on VS Code 
Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.
I can't compile and run NumberServer.java.
Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.

I did not change the given code at all. I think there might be a problem with my working directory...?

2.A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)

Have you tried `cd` into the folder that was just cloned, for example, `cd wavelet`. In the example that was refered to NumberServer.java is not in the current directory since it doesn't exist.
